# Etch-a-Sketch
This was one of, if not the first, project I created when I first started learning web development.

I have not updated the design for a couple of reasons:
  1. The purpose of this project is to showcase the skill of DOM manipulation and using
     JS event handlers by building a nostalgic device I used as a kid, not to be super pretty
  2. I appreciate looking back on my old code and designs.  It is easy to get frustrated and
     unhappy with the amount of progress you are making in your day to day, so it is nice
     to take a step back and reflect on how much progress I have made when I look back.
