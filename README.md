# Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch stands as one of my inaugural projects, marking my journey into the world of web development.

I've consciously chosen to retain the original design for this project, and here's why:

1. The primary objective of this project is to highlight my proficiency in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) and deploying JavaScript event handlers, all within the framework of constructing a digital replica of a device that played a significant role in my childhood. Its aesthetics are not the primary focus here.
2. Keeping a record of my older codes and designs provides an avenue for self-reflection. While the daily grind can sometimes lead to a sense of stagnation, revisiting my past work serves as a tangible testament to the strides I've made over time.
